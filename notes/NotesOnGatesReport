Table 2 provides a nice summary of the sources of variance both contextualizing them within Generalizability Theory as well as highlighting what sources are desirable and undesirable for the purposes of the measure (in this case consistent differentiation of teachers from each other). Reliability in this context is both interrater as well as test-retest.
Question: Do all 11 sources of variance come in to play for the different types of reliability?
