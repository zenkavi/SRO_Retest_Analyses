REMAINING DDM ANALYSES: sample size, turning h off

turn retest report to latex using papaja

SURVEY LABELING

How much do hddm parameters change when fitting to whole vs partial sample

How to reliabilities change w sample size (refit from 50 to 150) both for EZ and hddm (gives a prescriptive recommendation on which method to use depending on sample size)

Turn off h of ddm and see if it makes a difference

Order effects?

------------
robust samwich for standard errors

add 1 paragraph on what transformation effects are

eta sq: SStime/SStotal
partial eta sq: SStime+SSerror/SStotal

omega sq: ?? df correction

difficult to compare sem's across measures because it's unit dependant

DOES RELIABILITY FOR A TASK CHANGE DEPENDING ON HOW MANY TRIALS YOU USE TO ESTIMATE IT?
