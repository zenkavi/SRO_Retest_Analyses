- write python function for icc's

- make retest report (papaja)

SURVEY LABELINGGGGG

How much do hddm parameters change when fitting to whole vs partial sample

How to reliabilities change w sample size (refit from 50 to 150) both for EZ and hddm (gives a prescriptive recommendation on which method to use depending on sample size)

Turn off h of ddm and see if it makes a difference

Bayesian ways of test retest (esp for HDDM) -> contact MH

What is kl divergence

Order effects?

------------
robust samwich for standard errors

add 1 paragraph on what transformation effects are

eta sq: SStime/SStotal
partial eta sq: SStime+SSerror/SStotal

omega sq: ?? df correction

difficult to compare sem's across measures because it's unit dependant

for each task completion time difference (instead of individuals)

ADD AGE AND SEX SANITY CHCEK FOR THE RETEST DATA
DO RETEST ON ALL DEMOGRAPHICS
LEARNING EFFECTS FOR TASKS
DOES RELIABILITY FOR A TASK CHANGE DEPENDING ON HOW MANY TRIALS YOU USE TO ESTIMATE IT?

Can you use the test retest data to find who is amenable to an intervention?
Looking at the extent of change in the demographics etc and what that can be predicted by?
