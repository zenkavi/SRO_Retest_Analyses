How much do hddm parameters change when fitting to whole vs partial sample

How to reliabilities change w sample size (refit from 50 to 150) both for EZ and hddm (gives a prescriptive recommendation on which method to use depending on sample size)

Turn off h of ddm and see if it makes a difference

Bayesian ways of test retest (esp for HDDM) -> contact MH

What is kl divergence

State vs trait measures: e.g. if stroop distribution stayed the same across the time points but people moved around that would make stroop a ood state measure bud bad trait measure. Still it's a useful measure. For example if we had not controlled for subjects we would have considered this a successful replication. But perhaps it is a measure that ought not to be associated with trait measures in explaining the source of the variance

Order effects?

Reliability efficiency: using the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula can you calculate predicted reliabilities for each task to make them more comparable

robust samwich for standard errors

add 1 paragraph on what transformation effects are

add pearsons (and then figure out which to calculate)

eta sq: SStime/SStotal
partial eta sq: SStime+SSerror/SStotal

omega sq: ?? df correction

difficult to compare sem's across measures because it's unit dependant

for each task completion time difference (instead of individuals)
